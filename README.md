# Employees-And-Managers

In this assignment, you will create the domain models for a system to track employers and managers. In this case, you will not need a middle table to track the relationships because only a manager can have many employees. How would you change your domain model to reflect that? (Hint: @ManyToOne and @OneToMany)

Topics:
● Self Join

Tasks:
● Implement the domain model for the self join to work.

● Implement a getter method that will allow a manager to get all their employees.

● Implement a getter method that will allow an employee to get their manager.
